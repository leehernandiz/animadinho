The "Google Web Toolkit (GWT)":http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/ is an advanced AJAX framework that allows you to develop rich user interfaces in Java, thus taking advantage of type-checking and code re-use. GWT will then compile your Java code and generate fast, cross-platform Javascript that can be included in any web page you choose.

The plugin makes it easy to incorporate GWT code into your GSP pages, and it also simplifies the handling of RPC requests on the server. If you have not used GWT before, please read the documentation on the GWT website.

Jan Ehrhardt has kindly created a simple "tutorial":http://code.google.com/p/derjanandhisblog/wiki/GWTGrailsTutorial with sample code. Alberto Zaccagni wrote a "gwt on grails tutorial":http://www.lazywithclass.com/code/4/gwt-on-grails with a working example of client side passing a transfer object to the server side.

You can also join in the discussions about the plugin and ask questions on the "Google Group for GWT/Grails integration":http://groups.google.com/group/grails-gwt/
